# TSSV  (TypeScript SystemVerilog)

TSSV is a meta-HDL language written in TypeScript for creating highly parameterized and configurable synthesizable
SystemVerilog components improving productivity of hardware designers. It is intended to serve a similar role as
Chisel(Scala) but has a focus on trying to have a design paradigm and syntax that will be more familar to a
hardware design engineer familar with SystemVerilog.
